# Compact Survival

## A game about build up from nothing.

You start off with one block of space then you build up from there.

## How to Play?

There isn't much to do in the game right now till the soil, plant some seeds and gather seeds from the water.

To play you are going to want to start by building some farmland by pressing the green plus signs. Once you get some farmland you are going to want to till the soil by using the hoe. You can use the hoe by clicking on it on the toolbar at the bottom of the screen then clicking a untilled piece of a farmland. After you till the soil you are going to want to plant some seeds. Plant seeds the same way that you tilled the soil except use the seeds instead of the hoe. The last thing you can do is collect seeds by sieving through the water with the grass sieve.
